# Maze [⚠️WIP]
Amaze maze
## Vision
- [x] Generate Maze
- [ ] Add levels—How can I increase the complexity of the maze?
- [ ] Make this a web app
- [ ] In a web app, allow the user to have a position:
  - Time the game
  - Calculate the number of moves
  - Calculate the shortest path and display the number of moves
- [ ] Maybe I can store the user information in a relational DB and track their progress
- [ ] Create geo spacial mazes using open street map?
- [ ] Possible ar game?
